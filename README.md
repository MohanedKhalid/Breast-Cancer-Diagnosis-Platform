# Breast Cancer diagnosis Web Application

A web-based Breast cancer analysis tool built with Python, Flask, React and Vite, designed to analyze and visualize Mammogram data.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and analyze mammogram images
- Bounding box lesion localization using YOLOv8
- Cancer classification with CNN
- User-friendly interface
- Comprehensive report generation
- Flask API backend + React frontend

## 🎨 Technologies Used in Front-End

- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Firebase

## 🛠️ Technologies Used in Back-End

The following libraries and technologies were utilized in the project:

#### Python Libraries
1. **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
   - Object detection framework.
2. **TensorFlow / Keras**
   - CNN training and inference.

3. **sklearn (scikit-learn)**
   - Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

6. **Keras** (TensorFlow backend)
   
7. **Flask**
   - A micro web framework used to create the server for handling requests and responses.
   - Provides endpoints for model inference and data handling.

8. **Flask-CORS**
   - Used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the Flask application, allowing it to interact with front-end applications hosted on different domains.

9. **Keras**
    - Utilized for loading pre-trained models for deep learning tasks.

10. ****

11. **numpy,PLI,Matplotlib**
 - Image handling and visualization
    
12. **scikit-learn**

13. **os**
    - Used for interacting with the operating system for file handling and path manipulations.
